										<p>Undergrad software engineer</p>
									</header>
									<p>I am currently attending Arizona State University working on a Bachelor of Science for Software Engineering. I have been 
										interested in computer science, software development and aerospace ever since I was a young child. My long term goal
										is that I plan to earn graduate degree in a field of engineering related to aerospace.

											<h3>Automated Vegetable Slicer</h3>
											<h1>An embeded automated kitchen tool</h1>
											<p><br>This was a collaborative project involving a team of four but for brevity, I will stick mostly to my own individual contributions. For a university engineering class, I and three others created an automated vegetable slicer prototype 
												using an Arduino microcontroller in addition to other necessary motors and sensors.  I was personally responsible for writing the software for the embedded system that allowed the
												vegetable slicer to operate automatically. Furthermore, I created design mockups and illustrations and CAD designs for the final product. Included in the project folder is all of the code and designs I personally worked on. 
											<br><br>
											<span class="image left"><img src="images/plunger_with_tray_01.png" alt="" /></span>
											The aim of this assignment was to conduct interviews and then determine a viable product to put on the market using automation. After concluding interviews, it was clear that people wanted automated kitchen tools to make things in the kitchen 
											easier to reduce multitasking. After creating a Gant chart and designating roles, our team created the slicer, a demonstration and explanation of which can be seen saved as an .mp4 in the project file.

											<h3><br>Kanji Character Topological Sort</h3>
											<h1>A good use of data structures and algorithms</h1>
											<p><br>From this project, one of several explorations into complex data structures and algorithms, I attained a
												 unique insight into the powerful nature of directed graphs and how palpable they are when contrasted with the 
												 actual non-software world we live in. Much of how we operate day-to-day can be expressed in terms of relationships. 
												 So much of the material world such as bus schedules, job position hierarchies, music genres, historical events, etc., 
												 can be depicted using some graphical structure or another.  
											<br><br>
											<span class="image left"><img src="images/Kanji.png" alt="" /></span>
											Kanji (Japanese) characters are logographic, which is to say that they are symbols that represent simple ideas and together 
											make up sentences and ideas just as the Latin derived character set that we are used to. The difference is that Kanji characters 
											can be constructed from others, that is, simpler characters can bind together to express more complex ideas. For example, the characters for sun or day (日) can be combined with the character for moon (月) to create bright (明).  
											Using a directed graph and then performing a topological sort, the hierarchical structure of these characters can be fully visualized allowing individuals new to learning Kanji letters to organize the order in which they should learn them.

											<h3><br>JavaFX Checkers Game </h3>
											<h1>GUI checkers program</h1>
											<p><br>The least remarkable aspect of this project is the checkers game itself, but rather the way in which it was developed. The game was developed over the span of a university software enterprise course and was developed using SDLC 
												model including unit testing using JUnit, and EclEmma for code coverage, and JDOC for documentation, and of course exception handling. Upon completion of development, a peer code review was done in which afterwards necessary refactoring was done.    
											<br><br>
											<span class="image left"><img src="images/checkers_screen_shot.jpg" alt="" /></span>
											The checkers game in which I created is exactly like checkers except that there is no crowning of pieces added (at this time). Using the pieces to move on the virtual board, each player alternating turns, will select the piece they wish to move. 
											After selecting the desired piece, the possible moves that the player can make given their selected piece are illuminated in the form of JButtons onto the virtual board. The player has the option to select the move they want to make, or they can 
											reselect the piece to cancel the move and select another one instead. The game ends in one of two ways. First, a player’s pieces are all taken, and they cannot make any more moves. Second, the game can end if there are no more possible moves that a player can make.
